Version 20 was the same as Version 19, but with different numbers of bins, min and max values in histograms.

25/5/2018 Version 21: Histograms and ntuples filled with number of hits per strip. We consider that when the deposited energy in the volume of a strip exceeds 5000 X 3.67 eV [5000 e = signal threshold for a valid hit, 3.67 eV = energy needed for the production of an electron-hole pair], then we have a hit.

21/6/2018 Version 22: Hit multiplicity redefined (per event). Scintillator added. Pixel layer added to pixel detectors.

25/6/2018 Version 22: Calculation of x- and y-coordinates of impact points.

17/9/2018 Version 33: Bins of hit multiplicities fixed.

19/9/2018 Version 34: Reco-y splitted in three different histograms (y = -45 um, y = 0 um, y = 45 um).

27/9/2018 Version 35: Reco-y check per event option added: printing of every extrapolated and reconstructed position.

9/10/2018 Version 36: General particle source added. Changes made in PrymaryGeneratorAction and proton.mac. sigma of beam included.

10/10/2018 Version 37: Changed beam shape to ellipsoid and removed sigma.

21/12/2019 Version 49: This version is based on v37, ignoring the previous versions which were using geometries for the telescope planes different than those of the Phase-1 BPIX modules. Active thickness for strip sensors switched to 290 um, as these sensors will be used after all. Modules doubled in y-direction (although no pixel information available close to the edges: it's easier to switch between one- and two-module planes if avoiding to send the beam close to the edges of the plane). gps position = (-1, -0.1, -20) cm

22/12/2019 Version 50: Hit match finding added in 2S for a window of 5 strips. No check for distance to track yet.

23/12/2019 Version 51: Aluminum added in front of particle beam. Number of events with hit matches in 2S sensors printed out.

25/12/2019 Version 52: Positions of modules, scintillators, DUT and aluminium changed. z = 0 cm corresponds to z = 13.5 cm in real life. Second scintillator added.

26/12/2019 Version 53: Calculation of energy deposition in scintillators added.

28/12/2019 Version 53: Stub defined: If hit matching in 1st 2S sensor < 100 um away from track in y-direction, then we have efficiency = 1 for the current event.

3/1/2020 Version 54: xy coordinates of beam 20 cm after the last scintillator plotted.

4/1/2020 Version 55: Test version.

6/1/2020 Version 56: FWHM = 5 mm, halfx = halfy = 2.123 mm.
